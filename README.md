"# Project3-Grocery-Checking-Program" 

In this project, I was to integrate Python with C++ to read a file, create a new .dat file, create a histogram of that file and find the frequency of a certain item from that list. Some of the code was given in this project, which made it not so hard to complete.

I did particularly well in implementing the histogram portion of the code by reading from the .dat file, creating a while loop to read each line and putting them into their respective variables until the end of the file. For each line read, the frequency of that item is then replaced with the numeric amount of a special character.

I could enhance my code by creating a handling error code for when an item being entered is not in the list. This would make the code more efficient in checking for errors and thus, not ending the program.

I found that creating the code to create the histogram was the most challenging to write. I overcame this with the help of Google and YouTube. Websites such as stackoverflow.com and tutorialspoint.com was very helpful to see examples and explanations. On YouTube, I liked thenewboston and Caleb Curry.

The skills of integrating two different languages, I feel like will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work in the future. Something that I am looking forward to.

I made this program maintainable by creating functions that are reusable, easy to change in only one area: making it more readable and easily adaptable to other programs.
